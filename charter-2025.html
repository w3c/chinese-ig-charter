      <p class="mission">The <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/chinese-web/">Chinese Web Interest Group</a> provides a forum for W3C members to enhance the participation in Web standards work from the Chinese Web community. The group will focus primarily on identifying requirements of high priority to the Chinese Web community, on helping the Chinese members to get familiar with the process of W3C standards activities, on discussion of technical ideas with the potential to be proposed to W3C, on standards testing and implementation, as well as corresponding standardization opportunities for W3C while assisting the participation and contribution from the Chinese Web community.</p>

          Participation
        </h2>
        <p>To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have representatives from a major portion of W3C members in China for its duration. Individuals who wish to actively participate but are not affiliated with a W3C Member Organization are encouraged to apply to participate as an <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#invited-expert-ig">Invited Expert</a>.

        <p>The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.</p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

          Communication
        </h2>
        <p id="public">
          Informal coordination is done via the Interest Group's mailing lists, GitHub as well as other communication channels by consent of the participants. The Interest Group is a public forum; its mailing lists and archives are publicly accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          This group uses the public mailing list public-chinese-web@w3.org (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-chinese-web/">archive</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/chinese-ig">GitHub</a>.
        </p>
        <p>The meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review as well, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.</p>
        <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>
        <p>
          The Interest Group conducts its conversations primarily in Chinese. Liaisons with other W3C Groups will be conducted in English.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/ig/chinese-web/">Interest Group home page.</a>

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'>one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Interest Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
