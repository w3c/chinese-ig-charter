    <p class="mission">The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/chinese-web-ig/">Chinese Web Interest Group</a> provides a forum for W3C members to enhance the participation in Web standards
      work from the Chinese Web community. The group will focus primarily on identifying requirements of high priority to the Chinese Web community, on helping
      the Chinese members to get familiar with the process of W3C standards activities, on discussion of technical ideas
      with the potential to be proposed to W3C, on standards testing and implementation, as well as corresponding standardization
      opportunities for W3C while assisting the participation and contribution from the Chinese Web community.</p>

        Participation
      </h2>
      <p>
        To be successful, this Interest Group is expected to have representatives from a major portion of W3C members in China for
        its duration. Individuals who wish to actively participate but are not affiliated with a W3C Member Organization are encouraged
        to apply to participate as an
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#invited-expert-ig">Invited Expert</a>. We encourage all W3C members who are interested in helping to enhance the participation from
        Chinese members to join this Interest Group.</p>

      <p> The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described
        in Communication. </p>

        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the
          W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>

    <section id="communication">
      <h2>
        Communication
      </h2>
      <p>
        Informal coordination is done via the Interest Group's mailing lists, GitHub as well as other communication channels by consent of
        the participants. The Interest Group is a public forum; its mailing lists and archives are publicly accessible.</p>
      <p>
          This group uses the public mailing list public-chinese-web@w3.org (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-chinese-web/">archive</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/w3c/chinese-ig">GitHub</a>.
      </p>
      <p> The meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review as well, and technical
        discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general
        public. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however. </p>
      <p>The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.</p>
      <p>
        The Interest Group conducts its conversations primarily in Chinese. Liaisons with other W3C Groups will be conducted in English.
      </p>
      <p> Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings)
        will be available from
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/2018/chinese-web-ig/">the Interest Group home page</a>.

    <section id="decisions">
      <h2>
        Decision Policy
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">
          W3C Process Document (section 3.3)</a>. Typically, a participant makes an initial proposal, which
        is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal
        voting being required.</p>
      <p>
        However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the
        range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
      </p>
      <p>
        To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken
        in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued
        for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10
        working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised
        on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution
        of the Interest Group.
      </p>
      <p>
        All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless
        reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
      </p>
      <p>
        This charter is written in accordance with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document
        requires.

    <section id="patentpolicy">
      <h2>Patent Disclosures</h2>
      <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
        Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as set out in
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section 6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not produce Recommendation-track documents,
        when Interest Group participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working Groups, the patent disclosure
        obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the
